POST-PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS

Post-processing will happen in various phases


Work has been split into 26 files, a file per letter. Please tell me which file you work on, and send it back to me before you proceed with the next one.


FIRST PHASE


Cleanup material and make it as author intended. Note that the original contains numerous typos or small mistakes. These can be corrected silently. Make sure you are not correcting older useage of English, and take care to use clues given by the translations and the pronunciation. Put on-line resources to use.

In Tagalog, many word breaks need to be resolved, and probably a lot of accents verified.

In Spanish, many word accents need to be verified, and may follow older conventions.

I can split out files with only one type of line to ease spell-checking activities.

The work is split into lines, with each line preceeded with a single code to indicate what it is.

Codes used: H: Header; E: English; S: Spanish; T: Tagalog; C: Cross reference; N: Note; X: Anything else (or not yet determined).

Please leave or move informative proofers notes to separate N: lines. X: and N: lines will be removed from the final result later on.

The end-result of this phase will be posted to Project Gutenberg.


SECOND PHASE

Assembly in database

The entire contents of this file will be even more richly tagged and turned into a searchable database with a web interface.



THIRD PHASE

Modernization and extention.
