#summary How to present verb-conjugations in a easy way.

= Introduction =

Philippine languages can have complex verb-conjugations, which need to be presented in a easy-to-use way to learners.

= Details =

For various languages, on-line dictionaries present the various verb forms in an easy to use table

  * English _to drink_ on [http://verbs.woxikon.com/english-verbforms/drink.php Woxicon]
  * Germen _trinken_ on [http://verbs.woxikon.com/german-verbforms/trinken.php Woxicon]
  * Dutch _drinken_ on [http://verbs.woxikon.com/dutch-verbforms/drinken.php Woxicon]

As can be noticed, the table is different for each language, as are the terms used. We should present similar tables for Philippine languages.

A complicating factor here is that, unlike with most European languages, that there is little consensus names of the various moods and tenses in Philippine languages. What one author calls "active voice unreal potential" might be called "actor focus future ability" by another, with some subtle differences in meaning. Since we do not want to confuse users with linguistic theory, we will limit the use of such labels, and provide examples with English translations.
