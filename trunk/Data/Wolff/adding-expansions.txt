To add expansions to the entries of WCED, do the following:


Step 0:

    Before you start: study the introduction on how to handle
    the abbreviated sub-entries, in particular, study the meaning
    of paN-, -l-, -r-, Culu-. Also study the use of stress marks.

        Culu-   prefix consisting of the initial consonant of the root 
                followed by ulu
        -l-     infix consisting of l followed by the initial vowel 
                of the root
        r-      prefix consisting of the initial consonant followed by 
                the first vowel of the root
        x-      x is a prefix
        -x-     x is infixed after the initial consonant
        -x      x is a suffix
        x-y     x is a prefix, and y is a suffix

    Note also the em-dash and arrows used for sub-entry forms.

    Stress

        unmarked: stress is on the penultimate vowel.
        marked: otherwise.

Step 1: search for (regular expression):

        <form>[^<]*-[^<]*</form>

    This will find all forms with a dash in it. Also look for:

        <form>(&rarr;)</form>
        <form>(&larr;)</form>
        <form>[^<]*&mdash;[^<]*</form>

    A dash can have two meanings in those forms:

        a. Indicate omitted head-word
        b. Indicate syllable-inital glottal stop.

    We are only interested in the first (a) meaning. Sometimes, it will require
    some knowledge of the language to decide which meaning is intended.


Step 2: If a form contains a dash indicates an omitted head-word, then

        a. put { before it and |} after it.
        b. put the expanded form after the |.
        c. replace the omitted head-word dashes in the form before | with ~.
        d. apply the proper accent marks, if needed.
        c. insert a intial-glottal-stop dash if needed.

        You will end up with forms like:
            
            {~un|abgawun}
            {ma&N;~l~(&larr;)|mangalabay}


Step 3:

    After you take a break, register in this file how far you got:

    Letter:     Done up-to and including entry

Step 4:

    After all expansion have been marked, use a tool (to be developed)
    to replace them with proper TEI mark-up.

        <abbr expan="abgawun">-un</abbr>
