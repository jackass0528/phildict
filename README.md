Repository for Philippine language dictionary data

This repository includes a number of old (the most recent is from 1972) dictionaries of Philippine languages I've digitized
with the help of [Distributed Proofreaders](http://www.pgdp.net/c/). These are in various states of completeness.

Included are

 * **Sofronio G. Calderón**, *Diccionario Ingles-Español-Tagalog*, Manila, 1915.
 * **Juan Felis de la Encarnacion**, *Diccionario Espanñol-Bisaya*, Binonda, 1866.
 * **John Kaufmann**, *Visayan-English Dictionary*, Iloilo, 1934.
 * **Charles Nigg**, *A Tagalog-English and English-Tagalog Dictionary*, Manila, 1904.
 * **John U. Wolff**, *A Dictionary of Cebuano Visayan*, 1972.
 
 Also included are the specific scripts used to process these dictionaries (mostly in Perl).
 
 Further scripts for processing the TEI files generated from these files can be found in my [tei2html Project](https://github.com/jhellingman/tei2html)
